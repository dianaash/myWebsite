            Hello! <br />
            My name is Diana Ashktorab. <br />
            I'm a CodeNewbie from Iran which is a beautiful country with astonishing nature and lovely people. I was born in 2013.<br />
            My favorite hobby is watching animations and my favorites are
            Miraculous Ladybug and Pj masks. I also like drawing, reading story books and
            of course playing with my brother. Down here you can see a picture
            of us. I don't like homework because it's so boring .. I mean it. I think I'd better build a robot some day to do childern's homework so they can use their time for more creative stuffs.

            This is my little brother. His name is Shayan and he's 3 years old.
            His favorite animations are Racing Cars, Paw Patrol and Pj Masks
            (like me). He's soooooooo cute and we have fun together. I love him
            very much.<br />
            Nowadays, he's my best friend.

            I also love Moana animation and music who lives in Matonoi island.
            <br />
            Don't you think I look like her, because of my hair and my style
            that shows I'm brave like Moana? Am I? I Think so.<br />
            <br />
            Well, enough about my favorites! Let's talk about programming! OK.
            <br />
            I started learning programming concepts playing with
            GrassHopperApp in my mom's phone once in a while. In Augest 2020, my mom helped me
            to learn Scratch. It was so fun! I made some games you also could play;
            the links are available in my Projects Page.<br/>Two months later, I got interested in CSS because I love art. So, I started learning
            simple CSS.  Then I went further and experienced to make some
            illustrations in Single DIV ... That was incredible for me ...

            Then, I learned how to make SVG in Adobe Illustrator and this learning was super! I could make an SVG and animate it in CSS.
            I'm planning to learn JavaScript. I love to bring joy in programming and learning, make funny animations, funny games and also teach what I know to others. I usually do something funny in my tutorials that's because I like humor. I also like AI specially Robotics; who knows, maybe that will be one of my future challenges! or maybe I become a police officer:)
